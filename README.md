<h1 style="text-align:center;">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cole</h1>

- My name is Cole, but I go by MidLanerST in some areas

Often times, you can call me whatever you would prefer. I got the same several years back from some online games, but these days, I often just go by my name within my friend groups, and everyone else follows their lead.


- ðŸŒ± I'm a student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs studying Computer Security

Most often, you can find me working on STEM related curriculum to teach K-12 students, or whatever passion projects

- ðŸ“« If you need to reach me...


You can often send me an email at cole.snyder.m@gmail.com.
